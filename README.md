# EdgeDriver Distribution for Selenium-based automation scripts

Private EdgeDriver hosting for WebAutomation Solutions automation scripts.

---

## 📌 Notes

- This repo serves as a fallback for delivering EdgeDriver in case Selenium Manager or WebDriver Manager fails.
- Microsoft’s previous domain for delivering EdgeDriver binaries was retired (`msedgedriver.azureedge.net`).
- WebDriver Manager has not been functional for Edge since the 15th of July due to this deprecation .
- This approach avoids dependency on unstable upstream links.

---

## 🔁 Update Policy

We update the EdgeDriver binary monthly or as soon as new stable versions are released by Microsoft.

Release tags follow the version format:
```
v<version_number>
```
Example:
```
v138.0.3351.109
```
